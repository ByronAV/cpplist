# C++ Double Linked List

## Description
This is a mini project of a C++ Double Linked List. You can add, delete and find elements in the list as of 09/06/2023. New methods might be added in the future.

## Compilation
The building requires `CMake`. Build as follows:
```
cmake <build-dir>
```
then navigate to the building dir and just call `make`. This will create an executable file called `list`.
NOTE: In order to run the `make` concurrently you can run `make -j <number_of_threads>`
